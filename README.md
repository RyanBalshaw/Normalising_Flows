# Not All Flows Are Normal
My implementation of some interesting normalising flow cases in Pytorch. Tested on some simple 2D problems with a scalable implementation. Currently have implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item Planar Flows
\item Radial Flows
\item Real NVP Flows
\end{itemize}

I want to look at IAF, MAF and Parallel Wavenet next.
