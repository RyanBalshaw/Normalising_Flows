# Not All Flows Are Normal
My implementation of some interesting normalising flow cases in Pytorch. Tested on some simple 2D problems with a scalable implementation. Currently have implemented:

1. Planar Flows
2. Radial Flows
3. Real NVP Flows

I want to look at IAF, MAF and Parallel Wavenet next.
